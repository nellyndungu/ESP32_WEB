This project sets up an ESP32 in Access Point (AP) mode to generate and serve unique digital tickets directly to connected devices. 
The ESP32 creates its own WiFi hotspot, allowing users to connect without the need for an external router. 
Once connected, a built-in webpage is served where the user can enter their name to generate a personalized ticket.
